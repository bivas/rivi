# Simplify your review process

Managing a repository can require tedious administrative work, and as pull requests increase, it becomes even more complex. Todayâ€™s review flow lacks important visible information that leads to serious management issues.

Rivi is an innovative tool that automates repository management. Forget about manually checking which module was modified, or which people are in charge of a pull review, Rivi will do it for you.
Rivi enables automatic labeling with common parameters so that maitainers can immediately understand their repository status with a quick glance. It also assigns relevant people to pull request reviews, allows to add comments, merges pull requests, sends triggers to relevant systems and notifying them about issues that require prompt attention and more.

With Rivi, developers can focus on the actual code base and less on administrative unambiguous actions made every day.  We are looking to add more automation features to make the repository management process seamless, and our highest priority is to ensure that Rivi lives up to the community standards by providing true value and efficiency.

We'll guide you how to add `rules` to your `.rivi.yaml` files and make the most out of rivi.
